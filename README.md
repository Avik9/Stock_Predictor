# Stock Predictor

This was a semester long research project to learn how ARIMA works and how we can 
make time based predictions.

## Shampoo Sales

Since this was the first time working on it, we refered to an external sources 
(referenced below) to understand how ARIMA works and we could use time-series 
analysis to predict the future values.

## Apple

After studying the resources on shampoo sales, we tried to predict the stock 
prices for Apple and once we had them, we tried to increase the accuracy.
